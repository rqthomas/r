# Why macrosystems ecology and forecasting?
**Macrosystems ecology** is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales (e.g., Heffernan et al. 2014). Macrosystems ecology recently emerged as a new sub-discipline of ecology to study ecosystems and ecological communities around the globe that are changing at an unprecedented rate because of human activities (IPCC 2013). The responses of ecosystems and communities are complex, non-linear, and driven by feedbacks across local, regional, and global scales (Heffernan et al. 2014). These characteristics necessitate novel approaches for making predictions about how systems may change to improve both our understanding of ecological phenomena as well as inform resource management.

**Forecasting** is a tool that can be used for understanding changes in macrosystems ecology. To anticipate and prepare for increased variability in populations, communities, and ecosystems, there is a pressing need to know the future state of ecological systems across space and time (Dietze et al., 2018). Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for fluctuations in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasts are a powerful test of the scientific method because ecologists make hypotheses of how ecological systems work; embed their hypotheses in models; use the model to make a forecast of future conditions; and then when observations are available, see how their forecast performed, which indicates if their hypotheses are supported. Consequently, macrosystems ecologists are increasingly using ecological forecasts to predict how ecosystems are changing over space and time. However, forecasts must be effectively designed and communicated to those who need them to make decisions in order to realize their potential for protecting natural resources.

The theme of this module is understanding how **forecasts are connected to decision-making of stakeholders,** or those who use forecasts to aid in decision-making**.**Ecological forecasts have vast potential for aiding decision-making for range of different stakeholders, yet forecast results may be challenging to understand because they inherently are associated with uncertainty in alternate future outcomes which have not yet occurred. This module will teach students the basic components of an ecological forecast; the importance of connecting forecast visualizations to stakeholder needs for aiding decision-making; and to create their own visualizations of probabilistic forecasts of ecological variables for a specific stakeholder.

# Today&#39;s focal question:

## _How can ecological forecasts and their visualizations aid in decision making?_

To address this question, we will examine existing ecological forecasts to explore how decisions are made and how visualizations can be tailored to different stakeholders. We will be identifying the diversity of ecological variables currently being forecasted, as well as the different types of stakeholders and needs for making decisions with current ecological forecasts. We will also use output from a real water quality forecasting system to examine how uncertainty in forecast output changes over time, and how this can impact decision-making into the future. Lastly, we will explore how different ways of visualizing forecast output can be useful for different types of stakeholders of the forecast.

# Pre-Module Questions: Think about it!

Before starting Module 8, think through your experience using forecasts to make decisions and answer the following questions:

1. Name of a forecast that you have encountered.
2. How you do use this forecast to make decisions?
3. When are you more and less confident in using the forecast to make a decision?
4. What other groups of people do you think could use this forecast?
5. How do you access the forecast (e.g., through a website, app, etc.)?
6. How does the forecast represent the likelihood that the outcome will occur?
7. Would you be more confident in using the forecast to make a decision if you saw more or less information about the uncertainty?

# Activity A: Explore an existing ecological forecast
Many of us use various types of forecasts in our daily lives to make decisions (e.g., weather forecasts). However, we often take for granted the way in which the forecast is presented to us. In this activity, you will examine several ecological forecasts and analyze the visualizations they provide as decision-support tools for their users.

# Activity B: Make decisions informed by a real water quality forecast
Ecological forecasts have vast potential for aiding decision-making for range of different stakeholders, yet forecast results may be challenging to understand because they inherently are associated with uncertainty in alternate future outcomes which have not yet occurred. This activity will allow you to make decisions in order to optimize future drinking water quality. Forecasts will update through time, allowing you to see how forecast uncertainty changes over time, and how management decisions can impact water quality.

Read the following scenario and use it to complete Objecties 3-5.

**Scenario** : `r module_text["activityB_scenario1", 1]`\

`r module_text["activityB_scenario2", 1]`\

`r module_text["activityB_scenario3", 1]`\

Each day as you look at the forecast you must optimize your three objectives, trying to keep all of them as high as possible. Your decision alternatives include:

  1. Continue with the swimming event as planned.
  2. Cancel the swimming event.
  3. Treat the reservoir with an algaecide


## **Objective 3: Identify the components of the decision you need to make as a drinking water manager (PrOACT)**\

14. Identify the components of the decision you need to make as a manager (PrOACT)
  a. Problem(s):\
  **Answer:** `r params$a14_pr`\
  b. Objective(s):\
  **Answer:** `r params$a14_obj`\
  c. Alternative(s):\
  **Answer:** `r params$a14_alt`\
  d. Consequence(s):\
  **Answer:** `r params$a14_con`\
  e. Trade-off(s):\
  **Answer:** `r params$a14_tro`\
  

## **Objective 4a: Decide how to manage a drinking water reservoir using an ecological forecast**\

You now have access to the 14-day water quality forecast leading up to the day of the swimming event, June 6. Every day as time gets closer to the swimming competition, the forecast will update with new data, allowing you to update your decision. On each of the designated days, you must make a decision about whether to A) Continue with the swimming event as planned, B) Cancel the event, or C) Treat the reservoir with an algaecide. submit your answers below. Remember that the forecast includes 25 different ensemble members, which are different forecast estimates, and what you are seeing here is the mean of those ensembles.

As you make your decisions, remember that water becomes dangerous for drinking when the chlorophyll-a concentration goes above 25 ug/L and dangerous for swimming when the chlorophyll-a concentration goes above 35 ug/L.

## **Objective 4b: Decide how to manage a drinking water reservoir using an ecological forecast which shows uncertainty**\

Now, you will again make decisions about managing the reservoir over time, but this time you will use a different forecast visualization to make your decisions.

Examine the 14-day water quality forecast as you approach the day of the swimming event, June 6. The forecasts will update over time, allowing you to update your decision as the day gets closer. On each of the designated days, make a decision about whether to cancel the swimming event or not and submit your answers below.

# Activity C: Create a customized visualization of an ecological forecast for a specific stakeholder
Uncertainty is an inherently difficult concept to understand, and especially difficult to represent visually. There are many ways to represent uncertainty visually and it has been shown that different representations can lead to different levels of comprehension of the actual scenario. Further, the best way to visualize uncertainty is likely to vary between stakeholders, with some stakeholders needing more information than others in order to facilitate quick and accurate decision-making. This activity will allow you to role-play as a specific stakeholder, identify that stakeholder's decision needs, and create a forecast visualization of uncertainty tailored to that stakeholder.

## **Objective 6: Identify a stakeholder and how they could use a water quality forecast for decision-making**\
Using the same forecast as we used in Activity B to make decisions as a water quality manager, we will now customize the forecast visualization. It is important to consider who will be using your forecast to make decisions, as this can impact they way in which you visualize uncertainty.

**Choose a stakeholder from the drop-down menu and answer the questions below.**  

**You have chosen:** `r params$aobj6_stakeholder` `r params$aobj6_stakeholder_other`\

22. `r module_text["activityC_obj6_Q1", 1]`\
\
**Answer:** `r params$a22`\
23. `r module_text["activityC_obj6_Q23", 1]`\
\
**Answer:** `r params$a23`\

## **Objective 7: Explore variability in the forecast output**\

Below is a data table of forecast output of algal concentrations which you used in Activity B. In this activity, you will explore multiple ways of communicating this same forecast to create a customized forecast visualization for your chosen stakeholder.


**You have selected:** `r params$forecast_viz_date`\  

24. What is the mean concentration of all the ensembles?\
\
**Answer:** `r params$a24`\

25. What is the minimum concentration of all the ensembles?\
\
**Answer:** `r params$a25`\

26. What is the maximum concentration of all the ensembles?\
\
**Answer:** `r params$a26`\

27.  `r module_text["activityC_obj7_Q27", 1]`\
\
**Answer:** `r params$a27`\



## **Objective 8: Create a customized forecast visualization for your chosen stakeholder**\
Now that you are familiar with the forecast output from Objective 7, explore the following visualization options to make a customized visualization for your stakeholder.\
\
Your final visualization:

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
if (!custom_plot_chk) {cat("<!---")}
if(html_chk){
htmltools::htmlTemplate(params$custom_plot)
}

```
![](`r params$custom_plot`)  
*Figure 4. Custom plot made for `r params$aobj6_stakeholder` `r params$aobj6_stakeholder_other`.* 
```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
if (!custom_plot_chk) {cat("-->")}
```


Using your completed, customized visualization, answer the follow questions.
