EDDIE,"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules."
Macro,"Macrosystems ecology is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales. Our interdisciplinary team is developing flexible classroom modules that introduce undergraduate students to the core concepts of macrosystems ecology and ecological forecasting, supported by the NSF Macrosystems Biology program grant 1926050."
macro_EF,"We have developed the following four modules within the Macrosystems EDDIE framework to teach undergraduates to produce, interpret, and communicate ecological forecasts"
eco_forecast,Ecological forecasting is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting changes in ecosystems. It is is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty. This allows society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasters develop and update forecasts using the iterative forecasting cycle (see the figure above).
theme_mod8,"The theme of this module is to focus on how forecasts can be communicated within the iterative forecast cycle. More specifically, we will examine how forecasts are connected to decision-making of forecast stakeholders. This module will teach students different ways uncertainty can be visualized in forecasts; how uncertainty in forecast visualizations can influence decision-making; and to create their own visualizations of ecological forecasts tailored to a specific user.  "
LO1,Describe what ecological forecasts are and how they are used (Activity A)
LO2,Identify the components of a structured decision (Activity B)
LO3,"Discuss how forecast uncertainty relates to decision-making (Activity A, B, C)"
LO4,"Match stakeholder needs with different levels of forecasting decision support (Activity B, C)"
LO5,"Identify different ways to represent uncertainty in a visualization (Activity A, B, C)"
LO6,Create visualizations tailored to specific stakeholders (Activity C)
privacy_policy,This Shiny App does not collect or store your any of your data.
to_address_question,"To address this question, we will examine how uncertainty is visualized in ecological forecasts and how forecasts are used to make decisions. We will identify different ways in which ecological forecasts are currently visualized. We will also use a water quality forecasting system to make decisions about managing a drinking water reservoir, and examine how uncertainty in forecast output can influence decision-making. Lastly, we will explore  different ways of visualizing forecast output and how they can be tailored for different users of the forecast."
workflow1,"After you watch the PowerPoint presentation, you will launch the Shiny app to begin the module. You can work individually or in pairs to navigate through the upper tabs (e.g., ""Activity A"", ""Activity B"", and ""Activity C"")  to complete each of the objectives embedded within each tab. Within each activity tab, there are individual objectives which must be completed before moving onto the next one."
workflow2,There are questions in green text boxes embedded throughout the Shiny app which you should input your answers into.
workflow3,"When you finish all of the objectives and answer all questions, navigate to the ""Generate Report"" section in the ""Introduction"" tab. Click this button to create a Microsoft Word document with all of your answers embedded within. Once the 'Download Report' button appears, click this to download your answers and review them in Microsoft Word before submitting to your instructor."

activityA_obj2_Q13,Name one stakeholder who could use your partner's forecast. This can come directly from the website or can be hypothesized by you.
activityA_obj2_Q14,"Of the two forecasting systems being compared, which do you think is most useful for guiding the stakeholders you and your partner identified? Why?"
activityB_scenario1,"You and your partner are drinking water managers for the primary drinking water source reservoir for your city, which has ~300,000 residents. In 14 days, a major international swimming competition with an estimated ~2,000 participants will be held in the reservoir. As a result of hosting this event, the water utility will receive a direct bonus of >$3 million dollars from the city. However, the water utility is concerned about the reservoir's water quality at this time of year, as historically there have been major algal blooms, which typically require expensive water treatment techniques. Without treatment, algal blooms can pose potential health issues to aquatic life, swimmers, and the city's drinking water, which means you may have to cancel the swimming event if an algal bloom occurs. During the swimming competition, the water utility must continue to use the reservoir as a drinking water source, and so must balance the needs of maintaining safe water quality for drinking and swimming, ecological health of the reservoir, as well as the economic costs and benefits of treatment or holding the event."
activityB_scenario2,"Luckily, the reservoir was recently outfitted with a state-of-the-art water quality ensemble forecasting system. Every morning, managers receive a 14-day forecast of future algal concentrations in the reservoir, which are updated daily using sensors in the water. The forecast is ensemble-based meaning it produces 25 different forecasts of algal concentrations, allowing for uncertainty as to what will happen. Following local and national guidelines for beach closure, algal levels above 25 ug/L can be harmful for drinking without water treatment and detrimental to aquatic life, and levels above 35 ug/L are not suitable for human swimming."
activityB_scenario3,"As drinking water managers of the reservoir, you and your partner must decide how to manage the water quality in the reservoir every day over a 14-day period, using the forecasts as a guide. You can choose to continue with the event, cancel the event, or treat the reservoir with an algaecide. Algaecides are a management tool which decreases algal growth in the short-term but introduces harmful chemicals which can kill or harm aquatic organisms and can be dangerous to humans who come in direct contact with the water within 24-48 hours. "

activityC_obj8_Q8,"If you were customizing a visualization for this stakeholder, how might you alter your current visualization?"
proact_intro,"As a drinking water manager, you need to balance many different objectives. Your actions can influence the drinking water quality that is delivered to thousands of city residents, the ecological health of the reservoir, the economy of your city, and the safety of the swimmers in the reservoirs. Forecasts can help balance these decision objectives by facilitating structured decision-making. One type of structured decision-making tool is called PrOACT. Scroll through the presentation below to learn more about PrOACT and to help you answer the question below. "
